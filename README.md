# mooonpy
This repository is the start of the re-writing of LUNAR (https://github.com/CMMRLab/LUNAR), to allow LUNAR's abilities to be easily scriptable in Python and allow for quicker and easier generation of documentation using doc strings and sphinx. This repository will eventually be added to PyPi, but during the initial development will be used as a locally installed version using pip

## Installation
To perform a local install using pip you will run the following command (based on how Python was installed) in the first mooonpy/ directory (other files/folders should be seen like docs/ mooonpy/ LICENCE pyproject.toml ...). You will have to navigate to this folder in a command line prompt (based on how Python was installed).
* Anaconda (using Anaconda PowerShell Prompt or Anaconda Prompt)
  - pip install -e .
* Windows (using cmd or PowerShell)
  - python -m pip install -e .
